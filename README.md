## **Project Summary – Agentic AI Novel Writing Tool (Agentic IDE Analogy)**

### **Core Concept (Explicit Analogy)**

This project is **conceptually the same as an agentic AI coding IDE**, except the “codebase” is a **novel manuscript**.

* Code repository → Manuscript
* Files → Chapters / scenes
* Code context → Story context
* Bugs → Grammar, clarity, consistency issues
* Refactors → Rewrites / restructuring
* Generated code → Drafted scenes / chapters
* Diffs / patches → Text diffs
* Pull requests → Proposed edits requiring approval

The goal is to transfer the **agentic coding workflow** directly into long-form writing.

---

### **Product Identity**

Despite the IDE analogy, the **user-facing product is a normal, polished novel writing application**, similar to Scrivener or Dabble.

* Clean, distraction-free editor
* Chapter and scene organization
* Reordering, notes, and long-form writing support
* The app should feel like a writing tool first

The agentic AI exists **inside** this writing tool, not as the main UI.

---

### **Agentic AI Model**

The AI behaves like an **agentic coding assistant**, but operating on prose instead of code.

The agent:

* Has read access to the entire manuscript
* Can reason across chapters and scenes
* Can propose changes of any size or scope
* Can generate new chapters or rewrite existing ones
* Can produce summaries, reports, plans, and analyses

The agent is **not constrained in what it can generate or suggest**.

The **only constraint**:

* The agent cannot apply changes without explicit human approval

This is identical to how agentic coding tools propose diffs but do not auto-merge.

---

### **Two Operating Modes (Same as Agentic Coding Tools)**

#### **Quick Mode (Execution Mode)**

Equivalent to quick fixes in a coding IDE.

* Small, localized tasks
* Minimal explanation
* Immediate diffs or text inserts

Examples:

* “Fix grammar in Chapter 3”
* “Rewrite this paragraph to be tighter”
* “Summarize this scene”

---

#### **Planning Mode (Agent Mode)**

Equivalent to architectural or refactor planning in coding agents.

* Large or ambiguous tasks
* Deep reasoning
* May propose a plan before executing

Examples:

* “Review the manuscript for pacing issues”
* “Plan the next three chapters”
* “Draft the next chapter using previous chapters as context”
* “Rewrite the opening to improve the hook”

---

### **Diff & Approval Workflow**

All AI-generated changes are presented as:

* Text diffs
* New chapter drafts
* Proposed restructures

The user must explicitly:

* Accept
* Reject
* Or manually edit before applying

No silent edits. No hidden changes.

---

### **What the Agent Can Do (Explicitly Allowed)**

The agent may:

* Read and analyze any part of the manuscript
* Rewrite, refactor, or polish text
* Draft new chapters or scenes
* Identify grammar, pacing, or consistency issues
* Generate summaries and reports
* Suggest structural or narrative changes

This freedom is intentional and mirrors agentic coding tools.

---

### **What This Is Not**

* Not an AI chat app
* Not a one-click story generator
* Not continuous autocomplete
* Not AI acting without approval

---

### **End Goal**

To create a **writer-first novel writing application** that offers the same power, workflow, and safety model as an agentic AI coding IDE — except applied to storytelling instead of software.

**In one line:**

> *An agentic AI IDE, but the “codebase” is a novel.*
